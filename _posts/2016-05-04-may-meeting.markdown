We'll be having our monthly meeting next week on Monday, May 9th. Stephen
Mizell be speaking at this meeting on a JavaScript utility library called
[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and how it can do some really neat things to make
your JavaScript code better.

We'll be at the normal places of the Business Building on Murray State's campus
room 551 and CSI in Paducah. All are welcome to join at both locations!
