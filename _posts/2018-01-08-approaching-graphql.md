We'll be starting a new year of meetings on January 8th at 6pm in room 551 in the Business Building on Murray State's campus. Luke Thomas will be presenting "Approaching GraphQL."

> [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) is an exciting new query language for APIs. It is statically typed, backend and storage agnostic, and fun to use! Ever wanted to fetch multiple resources in a single request or only return exactly the data you need? Come hear Luke give an overview of this new query language and share his experience using GraphQL in production.

If you're building APIs or systems on the web, you'll want to check this out. We will have pizza and drinks.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!
