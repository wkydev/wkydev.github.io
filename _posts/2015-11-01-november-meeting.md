title: November Meeting
---

Just a reminder that we'll be having our monthly meeting again this month, though we are tentatively moving it ahead one week to November 16th. We will pass along more information as we make sure we have the room available and we figure out if we will have food or not.

Stephen Mizell (that's me) will be speaking on "Thinking and Discovering by Writing." It will be a look at how writing documentation can lead to creating better products.

Please check the [meetings page](/meetings/) for more information about the meeting.
