We will be having our meeting this month on March 14 at 6pm.  Please check out
our [meetings](/meetings/) page for information about the location.

This month, David Willems will be speaking about "System Engineering -
Conceptualizing, Defining, Developing, Designing and Producing Complex
Multidisciplinary Systems." The abstract is:

> This talk gives an overview of the system engineering process and describes
> system engineering activities in all phases of system development, from
> conceptualization to deployment. Some of the system engineering tools are
> described and some pitfalls are identified.

David Willems has spent most of his career working in the space industry. He
has worked on a variety of projects including the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS),
Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, Global Positioning
System (GPS) and ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites. Dave also spent a few years at ITT’s
corporate lab developing GaAs Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs).
In the last 10 years of his career, he provided technical leadership as a
system engineer. He holds 14 patents and has published numerous papers. Dave
retired from ITT Exelis as a Technical Fellow.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!
