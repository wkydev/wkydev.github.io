We hope everyone has had a great summer. We are getting ready to start back up
after taking a break, and we'll be having our first meeting next Monday,
September 12th at 6pm. We will be meeting in the normal locations, room 551 in
the business building at Murray State and at CSI at Paducah. All are welcome to
join. Check the [meetings page](http://wkydev.com/meetings/) for more
information.

This month, Barkley Hughes will be speaking about Swagger, a tool for creating
standards-based web API documentation.

Next month on October 10th, Brandon Sharp will be giving an introduction to
microservices using Azure Service Fabric.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there.
