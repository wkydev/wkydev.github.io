Just a reminder that we'll be having our meeting this month on April 13 at 6pm. Barkley Hughes from CSI will be speaking again this month on the topic of Web API 2 and OWIN. Barkley will be presenting again from CSI in Paducah. In Murray, we'll have room 551 in the Business Building and will be watching over WebEx.
