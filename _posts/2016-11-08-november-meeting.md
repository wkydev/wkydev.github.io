We'll be having our November on the 14th at 6pm, both in Murray and Paducah. Please see the [meetings page](/meetings/) for more details.

This month, Jessica Raes will be speaking, and her talk is titled "Fake It Until You Make It: Building Self-Confidence." As a young female developer, Jessica has had to learn how to overcome a lack of confidence and at times "fake" confidence in order to move further in her career. In this talk she will be sharing tips on how to build one of the most valuable developer traits; self-confidence.

We'll be having pizza and drinks at the Murray meeting. Looking forward to seeing everyone there!
