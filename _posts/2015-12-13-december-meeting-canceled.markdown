This is just a note that we will not be meeting this month on December 14th. We
will resume meetings in February 2016. Have a wonderful holidays!

Also, if you or someone you know would be interested in presenting a topic,
please email us and let us know! We have a couple of slots left for next year
and would love to fill them.
