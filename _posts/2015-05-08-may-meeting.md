title: May Meeting
---

This is a friendly reminder that we'll be meeting this upcoming week on May 11. Carlo Wahlstedt, Software Engineer on the Architecture team at CSI, will be presenting on "The Anatomy of Nuget." Here is a quick synopsis on the talk.

> A look into the guts of the package manager for the .NET development platform which allows developers the ability to quickly produce and consume packages comprised of assemblies. We will look into what NuGet is and why it is useful. What a package is and how to create one. How to consume a package and more.

We'll be watching via WebEx again. We'll have a place setup in the Business Building, room 551 on Murray State's campus and at CSI in Paducah. We'll also tweet a link to the WebEx the day of the meeting. We will not be having food this meeting.

Looking forward to seeing everything there!
